# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-AIML

### 1. Project Overview

Heart disease is the leading cause of death globally. Early detection is key to prevention, and AI-driven models can help by analyzing clinical data quickly and accurately.

This repository features:

* A trained *MLP neural network* and *Logistic Regression* baseline
* A user-friendly input interface 
* A dynamic *heatmap* for visualizing feature importance and correlation

### 2. Features & Highlights

* *Interactive Input Form*: Users can enter key parametersâ€”age, BP, cholesterol, heart rate, etc.â€”to receive the results whether you have risk of heart disease or not.
* *Model Comparison*: Compare performance between MLP and Logistic Regression using metrics like Accuracy.
* *Heatmap Visualization*: Displays both feature correlations and model sensitivity, highlighting which variables contribute most to predictions.

### 3. Performance

| Model               | Accuracy |
| ------------------- | -------- | 
| *MLP*               | 99%      | 
| Logistic Regression | 85%      |

MLP improved accuracy .

### 4. Tech Stack

* *Python*
* *Scikitâ€‘Learn, **TensorFlow, **NumPy, **Pandas*
* *Matplotlib/Seaborn* (for heatmap & charts)


### 5. Why It Matters

* Provides clinicians and users with *interpretable diagnostics*
* Enables clear comparison between neural network and traditional model
* Demonstrates meaningful *accuracy improvements* using neural networks

### 6. Next Steps

* ðŸš€ Deploy via Docker or web service
* Enhance *explainability* using LIME or SHAP
* Pilot in clinical settingsâ€”for real-world validation

### 7. Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repo and submit a PR.
